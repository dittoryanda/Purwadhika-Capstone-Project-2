This capstone project analyzes transactional data from an e-commerce company based in Pakistan, covering orders placed between 2016 and 2018. The primary objective is to generate valuable insights from this data that can help the company develop strategies to increase sales performance.

The analysis explores customer purchasing behavior, transaction patterns, and revenue contributions, applying data preprocessing, RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation, and K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer groups. Based on these findings, actionable recommendations are provided to support data-driven decision-making for improving customer retention, targeting high-value segments, and boosting overall revenue growth.
